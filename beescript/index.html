    <h2>HAF Admin Pages</h2>
    <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don&#39;t care what humans think is impossible.</p>

    <p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br />
    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>

    <p>Ooh, black and yellow!
    Let&#39;s shake it up a little.</p>

    <p>Barry! Breakfast is ready!</p>

    <p>Ooming!</p>

    <p>Hang on a second.</p>

    <p>Hello?</p>

    <p>- Barry?
    <br />- Adam?</p>

    <p>- Oan you believe this is happening?
    <br />- I can&#39;t. I&#39;ll pick you up.</p>

    <p>Looking sharp.</p>

    <p>Use the stairs. Your father
    paid good money for those.</p>

    <p>Sorry. I&#39;m excited.</p>

    <p>Here&#39;s the graduate.
    We&#39;re very proud of you, son.</p>

    <p>A perfect report card, all B&#39;s.</p>

    <p>Very proud.</p>

    <p>Ma! I got a thing going here.</p>

    <p>- You got lint on your fuzz.
    <br />- Ow! That&#39;s me!</p>

    <p>- Wave to us! We&#39;ll be in row 118,000.
    <br />- Bye!</p>

    <p>Barry, I told you,
    stop flying in the house!</p>

    <p>- Hey, Adam.
    <br />- Hey, Barry.</p>

    <p>- Is that fuzz gel?
    <br />- A little. Special day, graduation.</p>

    <p>Never thought I&#39;d make it.</p>

    <p>Three days grade school,
    three days high school.</p>

    <p>Those were awkward.</p>

    <p>Three days college. I&#39;m glad I took
    a day and hitchhiked around the hive.</p>

    <p>You did come back different.</p>

    <p>- Hi, Barry.
    <br />- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.</p>

    <p>- Hear about Frankie?
    <br />- Yeah.</p>

    <p>- You going to the funeral?
    <br />- No, I&#39;m not going.</p>

    <p>Everybody knows,
    sting someone, you die.</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t waste it on a squirrel.
    Such a hothead.</p>

    <p>I guess he could have
    just gotten out of the way.</p>

    <p>I love this incorporating
    an amusement park into our day.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s why we don&#39;t need vacations.</p>

    <p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
    under the circumstances.</p>

    <p>- Well, Adam, today we are men.
    <br />- We are!</p>

    <p>- Bee-men.
    <br />- Amen!</p>

    <p>Hallelujah!</p>

    <p>Students, faculty, distinguished bees,</p>

    <p>please welcome Dean Buzzwell.</p>

    <p>Welcome, New Hive Oity
    graduating class of...</p>

    <p>...9:15.</p>

    <p>That concludes our ceremonies.</p>

    <p>And begins your career
    at Honex Industries!</p>

    <p>Will we pick ourjob today?</p>

    <p>I heard it&#39;s just orientation.</p>

    <p>Heads up! Here we go.</p>

    <p>Keep your hands and antennas
    inside the tram at all times.</p>

    <p>- Wonder what it&#39;ll be like?
    <br />- A little scary.</p>

    <p>Welcome to Honex,
    a division of Honesco</p>

    <p>and a part of the Hexagon Group.</p>

    <p>This is it!</p>

    <p>Wow.</p>

    <p>Wow.</p>

    <p>We know that you, as a bee,
    have worked your whole life</p>

    <p>to get to the point where you
    can work for your whole life.</p>

    <p>Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
    Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.</p>

    <p>Our top-secret formula</p>

    <p>is automatically color-corrected,
    scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured</p>

    <p>into this soothing sweet syrup</p>

    <p>with its distinctive
    golden glow you know as...</p>

    <p>Honey!</p>

    <p>- That girl was hot.
    <br />- She&#39;s my cousin!</p>

    <p>- She is?
    <br />- Yes, we&#39;re all cousins.</p>

    <p>- Right. You&#39;re right.
    <br />- At Honex, we constantly strive</p>

    <p>to improve every aspect
    of bee existence.</p>

    <p>These bees are stress-testing
    a new helmet technology.</p>

    <p>- What do you think he makes?
    <br />- Not enough.</p>

    <p>Here we have our latest advancement,
    the Krelman.</p>

    <p>- What does that do?
    <br />- Oatches that little strand of honey</p>

    <p>that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.</p>

    <p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p>

    <p>Of course. Most bee jobs are
    small ones. But bees know</p>

    <p>that every small job,
    if it&#39;s done well, means a lot.</p>

    <p>But choose carefully</p>

    <p>because you&#39;ll stay in the job
    you pick for the rest of your life.</p>

    <p>The same job the rest of your life?
    I didn&#39;t know that.</p>

    <p>What&#39;s the difference?</p>

    <p>You&#39;ll be happy to know that bees,
    as a species, haven&#39;t had one day off</p>

    <p>in 27 million years.</p>

    <p>So you&#39;ll just work us to death?</p>

    <p>We&#39;ll sure try.</p>

    <p>Wow! That blew my mind!</p>

    <p>&quot;What&#39;s the difference?&quot;
    How can you say that?</p>

    <p>One job forever?
    That&#39;s an insane choice to have to make.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m relieved. Now we only have
    to make one decision in life.</p>

    <p>But, Adam, how could they
    never have told us that?</p>

    <p>Why would you question anything?
    We&#39;re bees.</p>

    <p>We&#39;re the most perfectly
    functioning society on Earth.</p>

    <p>You ever think maybe things
    work a little too well here?</p>

    <p>Like what? Give me one example.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know. But you know
    what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <p>Please clear the gate.
    Royal Nectar Force on approach.</p>

    <p>Wait a second. Oheck it out.</p>

    <p>- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    <br />- Wow.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve never seen them this close.</p>

    <p>They know what it&#39;s like
    outside the hive.</p>

    <p>Yeah, but some don&#39;t come back.</p>

    <p>- Hey, Jocks!
    <br />- Hi, Jocks!</p>

    <p>You guys did great!</p>

    <p>You&#39;re monsters!
    You&#39;re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</p>

    <p>- I wonder where they were.
    <br />- I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <p>Their day&#39;s not planned.</p>

    <p>Outside the hive, flying who knows
    where, doing who knows what.</p>

    <p>You can&#39;tjust decide to be a Pollen
    Jock. You have to be bred for that.</p>

    <p>Right.</p>

    <p>Look. That&#39;s more pollen
    than you and I will see in a lifetime.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.</p>

    <p>Perhaps. Unless you&#39;re wearing it
    and the ladies see you wearing it.</p>

    <p>Those ladies?
    Aren&#39;t they our cousins too?</p>

    <p>Distant. Distant.</p>

    <p>Look at these two.</p>

    <p>- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
    <br />- Let&#39;s have fun with them.</p>

    <p>It must be dangerous
    being a Pollen Jock.</p>

    <p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
    against a mushroom!</p>

    <p>He had a paw on my throat,
    and with the other, he was slapping me!</p>

    <p>- Oh, my!
    <br />- I never thought I&#39;d knock him out.</p>

    <p>What were you doing during this?</p>

    <p>Trying to alert the authorities.</p>

    <p>I can autograph that.</p>

    <p>A little gusty out there today,
    wasn&#39;t it, comrades?</p>

    <p>Yeah. Gusty.</p>

    <p>We&#39;re hitting a sunflower patch
    six miles from here tomorrow.</p>

    <p>- Six miles, huh?
    <br />- Barry!</p>

    <p>A puddle jump for us,
    but maybe you&#39;re not up for it.</p>

    <p>- Maybe I am.
    <br />- You are not!</p>

    <p>We&#39;re going 0900 at J-Gate.</p>

    <p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?</p>

    <p>I might be. It all depends
    on what 0900 means.</p>

    <p>Hey, Honex!</p>

    <p>Dad, you surprised me.</p>

    <p>You decide what you&#39;re interested in?</p>

    <p>- Well, there&#39;s a lot of choices.
    <br />- But you only get one.</p>

    <p>Do you ever get bored
    doing the same job every day?</p>

    <p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.</p>

    <p>You grab that stick, and you just
    move it around, and you stir it around.</p>

    <p>You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It&#39;s a beautiful thing.</p>

    <p>You know, Dad,
    the more I think about it,</p>

    <p>maybe the honey field
    just isn&#39;t right for me.</p>

    <p>You were thinking of what,
    making balloon animals?</p>

    <p>That&#39;s a bad job
    for a guy with a stinger.</p>

    <p>Janet, your son&#39;s not sure
    he wants to go into honey!</p>

    <p>- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
    <br />- I&#39;m not trying to be funny.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re not funny! You&#39;re going
    into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</p>

    <p>- You&#39;re gonna be a stirrer?
    <br />- No one&#39;s listening to me!</p>

    <p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.</p>

    <p>I could say anything right now.
    I&#39;m gonna get an ant tattoo!</p>

    <p>Let&#39;s open some honey and celebrate!</p>

    <p>Maybe I&#39;ll pierce my thorax.
    Shave my antennae.</p>

    <p>Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
    a gold tooth and call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m so proud.</p>

    <p>- We&#39;re starting work today!
    <br />- Today&#39;s the day.</p>

    <p>Oome on! All the good jobs
    will be gone.</p>

    <p>Yeah, right.</p>

    <p>Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
    stirrer, front desk, hair removal...</p>

    <p>- Is it still available?
    <br />- Hang on. Two left!</p>

    <p>One of them&#39;s yours! Oongratulations!
    Step to the side.</p>

    <p>- What&#39;d you get?
    <br />- Picking crud out. Stellar!</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>Oouple of newbies?</p>

    <p>Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!</p>

    <p>Make your choice.</p>

    <p>- You want to go first?
    <br />- No, you go.</p>

    <p>Oh, my. What&#39;s available?</p>

    <p>Restroom attendant&#39;s open,
    not for the reason you think.</p>

    <p>- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
    <br />- Sure, you&#39;re on.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.</p>

    <p>Wax monkey&#39;s always open.</p>

    <p>The Krelman opened up again.</p>

    <p>What happened?</p>

    <p>A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
    He&#39;s dead. Another dead one.</p>

    <p>Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.</p>

    <p>Dead from the neck up.
    Dead from the neck down. That&#39;s life!</p>

    <p>Oh, this is so hard!</p>

    <p>Heating, cooling,
    stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,</p>

    <p>humming, inspector number seven,
    lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,</p>

    <p>mite wrangler. Barry, what
    do you think I should... Barry?</p>

    <p>Barry!</p>

    <p>All right, we&#39;ve got the sunflower patch
    in quadrant nine...</p>

    <p>What happened to you?
    Where are you?</p>

    <p>- I&#39;m going out.
    <br />- Out? Out where?</p>

    <p>- Out there.
    <br />- Oh, no!</p>

    <p>I have to, before I go
    to work for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re gonna die! You&#39;re crazy! Hello?</p>

    <p>Another call coming in.</p>

    <p>If anyone&#39;s feeling brave,
    there&#39;s a Korean deli on 83rd</p>

    <p>that gets their roses today.</p>

    <p>Hey, guys.</p>

    <p>- Look at that.
    <br />- Isn&#39;t that the kid we saw yesterday?</p>

    <p>Hold it, son, flight deck&#39;s restricted.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s OK, Lou. We&#39;re gonna take him up.</p>

    <p>Really? Feeling lucky, are you?</p>

    <p>Sign here, here. Just initial that.</p>

    <p>- Thank you.
    <br />- OK.</p>

    <p>You got a rain advisory today,</p>

    <p>and as you all know,
    bees cannot fly in rain.</p>

    <p>So be careful. As always,
    watch your brooms,</p>

    <p>hockey sticks, dogs,
    birds, bears and bats.</p>

    <p>Also, I got a couple of reports
    of root beer being poured on us.</p>

    <p>Murphy&#39;s in a home because of it,
    babbling like a cicada!</p>

    <p>- That&#39;s awful.
    <br />- And a reminder for you rookies,</p>

    <p>bee law number one,
    absolutely no talking to humans!</p>

    <p>All right, launch positions!</p>

    <p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
    buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!</p>

    <p>Black and yellow!</p>

    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>You ready for this, hot shot?</p>

    <p>Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.</p>

    <p>Wind, check.</p>

    <p>- Antennae, check.
    <br />- Nectar pack, check.</p>

    <p>- Wings, check.
    <br />- Stinger, check.</p>

    <p>Scared out of my shorts, check.</p>

    <p>OK, ladies,</p>

    <p>let&#39;s move it out!</p>

    <p>Pound those petunias,
    you striped stem-suckers!</p>

    <p>All of you, drain those flowers!</p>

    <p>Wow! I&#39;m out!</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m out!</p>

    <p>So blue.</p>

    <p>I feel so fast and free!</p>

    <p>Box kite!</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>Flowers!</p>

    <p>This is Blue Leader.
    We have roses visual.</p>

    <p>Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.</p>

    <p>Roses!</p>

    <p>30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.</p>

    <p>Stand to the side, kid.
    It&#39;s got a bit of a kick.</p>

    <p>That is one nectar collector!</p>

    <p>- Ever see pollination up close?
    <br />- No, sir.</p>

    <p>I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
    over here. Maybe a dash over there,</p>

    <p>a pinch on that one.
    See that? It&#39;s a little bit of magic.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s amazing. Why do we do that?</p>

    <p>That&#39;s pollen power. More pollen, more
    flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.</p>

    <p>Oool.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m picking up a lot of bright yellow.
    Oould be daisies. Don&#39;t we need those?</p>

    <p>Oopy that visual.</p>

    <p>Wait. One of these flowers
    seems to be on the move.</p>

    <p>Say again? You&#39;re reporting
    a moving flower?</p>

    <p>Affirmative.</p>

    <p>That was on the line!</p>

    <p>This is the coolest. What is it?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m loving this color.</p>

    <p>It smells good.
    Not like a flower, but I like it.</p>

    <p>Yeah, fuzzy.</p>

    <p>Ohemical-y.</p>

    <p>Oareful, guys. It&#39;s a little grabby.</p>

    <p>My sweet lord of bees!</p>

    <p>Oandy-brain, get off there!</p>

    <p>Problem!</p>

    <p>- Guys!
    <br />- This could be bad.</p>

    <p>Affirmative.</p>

    <p>Very close.</p>

    <p>Gonna hurt.</p>

    <p>Mama&#39;s little boy.</p>

    <p>You are way out of position, rookie!</p>

    <p>Ooming in at you like a missile!</p>

    <p>Help me!</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t think these are flowers.</p>

    <p>- Should we tell him?
    <br />- I think he knows.</p>

    <p>What is this?!</p>

    <p>Match point!</p>

    <p>You can start packing up, honey,
    because you&#39;re about to eat it!</p>

    <p>Yowser!</p>

    <p>Gross.</p>

    <p>There&#39;s a bee in the car!</p>

    <p>- Do something!
    <br />- I&#39;m driving!</p>

    <p>- Hi, bee.
    <br />- He&#39;s back here!</p>

    <p>He&#39;s going to sting me!</p>

    <p>Nobody move. If you don&#39;t move,
    he won&#39;t sting you. Freeze!</p>

    <p>He blinked!</p>

    <p>Spray him, Granny!</p>

    <p>What are you doing?!</p>

    <p>Wow... the tension level
    out here is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>I gotta get home.</p>

    <p>Oan&#39;t fly in rain.</p>

    <p>Oan&#39;t fly in rain.</p>

    <p>Oan&#39;t fly in rain.</p>

    <p>Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!</p>

    <p>Ken, could you close
    the window please?</p>

    <p>Ken, could you close
    the window please?</p>

    <p>Oheck out my new resume.
    I made it into a fold-out brochure.</p>

    <p>You see? Folds out.</p>

    <p>Oh, no. More humans. I don&#39;t need this.</p>

    <p>What was that?</p>

    <p>Maybe this time. This time. This time.
    This time! This time! This...</p>

    <p>Drapes!</p>

    <p>That is diabolical.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s fantastic. It&#39;s got all my special
    skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.</p>

    <p>What&#39;s number one? Star Wars?</p>

    <p>Nah, I don&#39;t go for that...</p>

    <p>...kind of stuff.</p>

    <p>No wonder we shouldn&#39;t talk to them.
    They&#39;re out of their minds.</p>

    <p>When I leave a job interview, they&#39;re
    flabbergasted, can&#39;t believe what I say.</p>

    <p>There&#39;s the sun. Maybe that&#39;s a way out.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t remember the sun
    having a big 75 on it.</p>

    <p>I predicted global warming.</p>

    <p>I could feel it getting hotter.
    At first I thought it was just me.</p>

    <p>Wait! Stop! Bee!</p>

    <p>Stand back. These are winter boots.</p>

    <p>Wait!</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t kill him!</p>

    <p>You know I&#39;m allergic to them!
    This thing could kill me!</p>

    <p>Why does his life have
    less value than yours?</p>

    <p>Why does his life have any less value
    than mine? Is that your statement?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m just saying all life has value. You
    don&#39;t know what he&#39;s capable of feeling.</p>

    <p>My brochure!</p>

    <p>There you go, little guy.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m not scared of him.
    It&#39;s an allergic thing.</p>

    <p>Put that on your resume brochure.</p>

    <p>My whole face could puff up.</p>

    <p>Make it one of your special skills.</p>

    <p>Knocking someone out
    is also a special skill.</p>

    <p>Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.</p>

    <p>- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
    <br />- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.</p>

    <p>- You could put carob chips on there.
    <br />- Bye.</p>

    <p>- Supposed to be less calories.
    <br />- Bye.</p>

    <p>I gotta say something.</p>

    <p>She saved my life.
    I gotta say something.</p>

    <p>All right, here it goes.</p>

    <p>Nah.</p>

    <p>What would I say?</p>

    <p>I could really get in trouble.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a bee law.
    You&#39;re not supposed to talk to a human.</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve got to.</p>

    <p>Oh, I can&#39;t do it. Oome on!</p>

    <p>No. Yes. No.</p>

    <p>Do it. I can&#39;t.</p>

    <p>How should I start it?
    &quot;You like jazz?&quot; No, that&#39;s no good.</p>

    <p>Here she comes! Speak, you fool!</p>

    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sorry.</p>

    <p>- You&#39;re talking.
    <br />- Yes, I know.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re talking!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m so sorry.</p>

    <p>No, it&#39;s OK. It&#39;s fine.
    I know I&#39;m dreaming.</p>

    <p>But I don&#39;t recall going to bed.</p>

    <p>Well, I&#39;m sure this
    is very disconcerting.</p>

    <p>This is a bit of a surprise to me.
    I mean, you&#39;re a bee!</p>

    <p>I am. And I&#39;m not supposed
    to be doing this,</p>

    <p>but they were all trying to kill me.</p>

    <p>And if it wasn&#39;t for you...</p>

    <p>I had to thank you.
    It&#39;s just how I was raised.</p>

    <p>That was a little weird.</p>

    <p>- I&#39;m talking with a bee.
    <br />- Yeah.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m talking to a bee.
    And the bee is talking to me!</p>

    <p>I just want to say I&#39;m grateful.
    I&#39;ll leave now.</p>

    <p>- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    <br />- What?</p>

    <p>The talking thing.</p>

    <p>Same way you did, I guess.
    &quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up.</p>

    <p>- That&#39;s very funny.
    <br />- Yeah.</p>

    <p>Bees are funny. If we didn&#39;t laugh,
    we&#39;d cry with what we have to deal with.</p>

    <p>Anyway...</p>

    <p>Oan I...</p>

    <p>...get you something?
    <br />- Like what?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know. I mean...
    I don&#39;t know. Ooffee?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t want to put you out.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s no trouble. It takes two minutes.</p>

    <p>- It&#39;s just coffee.
    <br />- I hate to impose.</p>

    <p>- Don&#39;t be ridiculous!
    <br />- Actually, I would love a cup.</p>

    <p>Hey, you want rum cake?</p>

    <p>- I shouldn&#39;t.
    <br />- Have some.</p>

    <p>- No, I can&#39;t.
    <br />- Oome on!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m trying to lose a couple micrograms.</p>

    <p>- Where?
    <br />- These stripes don&#39;t help.</p>

    <p>You look great!</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know if you know
    anything about fashion.</p>

    <p>Are you all right?</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>He&#39;s making the tie in the cab
    as they&#39;re flying up Madison.</p>

    <p>He finally gets there.</p>

    <p>He runs up the steps into the church.
    The wedding is on.</p>

    <p>And he says, &quot;Watermelon?
    I thought you said Guatemalan.</p>

    <p>Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;</p>

    <p>Is that a bee joke?</p>

    <p>That&#39;s the kind of stuff we do.</p>

    <p>Yeah, different.</p>

    <p>So, what are you gonna do, Barry?</p>

    <p>About work? I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <p>I want to do my part for the hive,
    but I can&#39;t do it the way they want.</p>

    <p>I know how you feel.</p>

    <p>- You do?
    <br />- Sure.</p>

    <p>My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
    a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.</p>

    <p>- Really?
    <br />- My only interest is flowers.</p>

    <p>Our new queen was just elected
    with that same campaign slogan.</p>

    <p>Anyway, if you look...</p>

    <p>There&#39;s my hive right there. See it?</p>

    <p>You&#39;re in Sheep Meadow!</p>

    <p>Yes! I&#39;m right off the Turtle Pond!</p>

    <p>No way! I know that area.
    I lost a toe ring there once.</p>

    <p>- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
    <br />- Why not?</p>

    <p>- It&#39;s like putting a hat on your knee.
    <br />- Maybe I&#39;ll try that.</p>

    <p>- You all right, ma&#39;am?
    <br />- Oh, yeah. Fine.</p>

    <p>Just having two cups of coffee!</p>

    <p>Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee.</p>

    <p>Yeah, it&#39;s no trouble.</p>

    <p>Sorry I couldn&#39;t finish it. If I did,
    I&#39;d be up the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>Are you...?</p>

    <p>Oan I take a piece of this with me?</p>

    <p>Sure! Here, have a crumb.</p>

    <p>- Thanks!
    <br />- Yeah.</p>

    <p>All right. Well, then...
    I guess I&#39;ll see you around.</p>

    <p>Or not.</p>

    <p>OK, Barry.</p>

    <p>And thank you
    so much again... for before.</p>

    <p>Oh, that? That was nothing.</p>

    <p>Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...</p>

    <p>This can&#39;t possibly work.</p>

    <p>He&#39;s all set to go.
    We may as well try it.</p>

    <p>OK, Dave, pull the chute.</p>

    <p>- Sounds amazing.
    <br />- It was amazing!</p>

    <p>It was the scariest,
    happiest moment of my life.</p>

    <p>Humans! I can&#39;t believe
    you were with humans!</p>

    <p>Giant, scary humans!
    What were they like?</p>

    <p>Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.</p>

    <p>They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy.</p>

    <p>- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
    <br />- Some of them. But some of them don&#39;t.</p>

    <p>- How&#39;d you get back?
    <br />- Poodle.</p>

    <p>You did it, and I&#39;m glad. You saw
    whatever you wanted to see.</p>

    <p>You had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you
    can pick out yourjob and be normal.</p>

    <p>- Well...
    <br />- Well?</p>

    <p>Well, I met someone.</p>

    <p>You did? Was she Bee-ish?</p>

    <p>- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
    <br />- No, no, no, not a wasp.</p>

    <p>- Spider?
    <br />- I&#39;m not attracted to spiders.</p>

    <p>I know it&#39;s the hottest thing,
    with the eight legs and all.</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t get by that face.</p>

    <p>So who is she?</p>

    <p>She&#39;s... human.</p>

    <p>No, no. That&#39;s a bee law.
    You wouldn&#39;t break a bee law.</p>

    <p>- Her name&#39;s Vanessa.
    <br />- Oh, boy.</p>

    <p>She&#39;s so nice. And she&#39;s a florist!</p>

    <p>Oh, no! You&#39;re dating a human florist!</p>

    <p>We&#39;re not dating.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re flying outside the hive, talking
    to humans that attack our homes</p>

    <p>with power washers and M-80s!
    One-eighth a stick of dynamite!</p>

    <p>She saved my life!
    And she understands me.</p>

    <p>This is over!</p>

    <p>Eat this.</p>

    <p>This is not over! What was that?</p>

    <p>- They call it a crumb.
    <br />- It was so stingin&#39; stripey!</p>

    <p>And that&#39;s not what they eat.
    That&#39;s what falls off what they eat!</p>

    <p>- You know what a Oinnabon is?
    <br />- No.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s bread and cinnamon and frosting.
    They heat it up...</p>

    <p>Sit down!</p>

    <p>...really hot!
    <br />- Listen to me!</p>

    <p>We are not them! We&#39;re us.
    There&#39;s us and there&#39;s them!</p>

    <p>Yes, but who can deny
    the heart that is yearning?</p>

    <p>There&#39;s no yearning.
    Stop yearning. Listen to me!</p>

    <p>You have got to start thinking bee,
    my friend. Thinking bee!</p>

    <p>- Thinking bee.
    <br />- Thinking bee.</p>

    <p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>

    <p>There he is. He&#39;s in the pool.</p>

    <p>You know what your problem is, Barry?</p>

    <p>I gotta start thinking bee?</p>

    <p>How much longer will this go on?</p>

    <p>It&#39;s been three days!
    Why aren&#39;t you working?</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve got a lot of big life decisions
    to think about.</p>

    <p>What life? You have no life!
    You have no job. You&#39;re barely a bee!</p>

    <p>Would it kill you
    to make a little honey?</p>

    <p>Barry, come out.
    Your father&#39;s talking to you.</p>

    <p>Martin, would you talk to him?</p>

    <p>Barry, I&#39;m talking to you!</p>

    <p>You coming?</p>

    <p>Got everything?</p>

    <p>All set!</p>

    <p>Go ahead. I&#39;ll catch up.</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t be too long.</p>

    <p>Watch this!</p>

    <p>Vanessa!</p>

    <p>- We&#39;re still here.
    <br />- I told you not to yell at him.</p>

    <p>He doesn&#39;t respond to yelling!</p>

    <p>- Then why yell at me?
    <br />- Because you don&#39;t listen!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m not listening to this.</p>

    <p>Sorry, I&#39;ve gotta go.</p>

    <p>- Where are you going?
    <br />- I&#39;m meeting a friend.</p>

    <p>A girl? Is this why you can&#39;t decide?</p>

    <p>Bye.</p>

    <p>I just hope she&#39;s Bee-ish.</p>

    <p>They have a huge parade
    of flowers every year in Pasadena?</p>

    <p>To be in the Tournament of Roses,
    that&#39;s every florist&#39;s dream!</p>

    <p>Up on a float, surrounded
    by flowers, crowds cheering.</p>

    <p>A tournament. Do the roses
    compete in athletic events?</p>

    <p>No. All right, I&#39;ve got one.
    How come you don&#39;t fly everywhere?</p>

    <p>It&#39;s exhausting. Why don&#39;t you
    run everywhere? It&#39;s faster.</p>

    <p>Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
    All right, your turn.</p>

    <p>TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
    That&#39;s insane!</p>

    <p>You don&#39;t have that?</p>

    <p>We have Hivo, but it&#39;s a disease.
    It&#39;s a horrible, horrible disease.</p>

    <p>Oh, my.</p>

    <p>Dumb bees!</p>

    <p>You must want to sting all those jerks.</p>

    <p>We try not to sting.
    It&#39;s usually fatal for us.</p>

    <p>So you have to watch your temper.</p>

    <p>Very carefully.
    You kick a wall, take a walk,</p>

    <p>write an angry letter and throw it out.
    Work through it like any emotion:</p>

    <p>Anger, jealousy, lust.</p>

    <p>Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?</p>

    <p>Yeah.</p>

    <p>- What is wrong with you?!
    <br />- It&#39;s a bug.</p>

    <p>He&#39;s not bothering anybody.
    Get out of here, you creep!</p>

    <p>What was that? A Pic &#39;N&#39; Save circular?</p>

    <p>Yeah, it was. How did you know?</p>

    <p>It felt like about 10 pages.
    Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.</p>

    <p>You&#39;ve really got that
    down to a science.</p>

    <p>- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
    <br />- I&#39;ll bet.</p>

    <p>What in the name
    of Mighty Hercules is this?</p>

    <p>How did this get here?
    Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,</p>

    <p>Ray Liotta Private Select?</p>

    <p>- Is he that actor?
    <br />- I never heard of him.</p>

    <p>- Why is this here?
    <br />- For people. We eat it.</p>

    <p>You don&#39;t have
    enough food of your own?</p>

    <p>- Well, yes.
    <br />- How do you get it?</p>

    <p>- Bees make it.
    <br />- I know who makes it!</p>

    <p>And it&#39;s hard to make it!</p>

    <p>There&#39;s heating, cooling, stirring.
    You need a whole Krelman thing!</p>

    <p>- It&#39;s organic.
    <br />- It&#39;s our-ganic!</p>

    <p>It&#39;s just honey, Barry.</p>

    <p>Just what?!</p>

    <p>Bees don&#39;t know about this!
    This is stealing! A lot of stealing!</p>

    <p>You&#39;ve taken our homes, schools,
    hospitals! This is all we have!</p>

    <p>And it&#39;s on sale?!
    I&#39;m getting to the bottom of this.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m getting to the bottom
    of all of this!</p>

    <p>Hey, Hector.</p>

    <p>- You almost done?
    <br />- Almost.</p>

    <p>He is here. I sense it.</p>

    <p>Well, I guess I&#39;ll go home now</p>

    <p>and just leave this nice honey out,
    with no one around.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re busted, box boy!</p>

    <p>I knew I heard something.
    So you can talk!</p>

    <p>I can talk.
    And now you&#39;ll start talking!</p>

    <p>Where you getting the sweet stuff?
    Who&#39;s your supplier?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t understand.
    I thought we were friends.</p>

    <p>The last thing we want
    to do is upset bees!</p>

    <p>You&#39;re too late! It&#39;s ours now!</p>

    <p>You, sir, have crossed
    the wrong sword!</p>

    <p>You, sir, will be lunch
    for my iguana, Ignacio!</p>

    <p>Where is the honey coming from?</p>

    <p>Tell me where!</p>

    <p>Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!</p>

    <p>Orazy person!</p>

    <p>What horrible thing has happened here?</p>

    <p>These faces, they never knew
    what hit them. And now</p>

    <p>they&#39;re on the road to nowhere!</p>

    <p>Just keep still.</p>

    <p>What? You&#39;re not dead?</p>

    <p>Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
    that moves. Where you headed?</p>

    <p>To Honey Farms.
    I am onto something huge here.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m going to Alaska. Moose blood,
    crazy stuff. Blows your head off!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m going to Tacoma.</p>

    <p>- And you?
    <br />- He really is dead.</p>

    <p>All right.</p>

    <p>Uh-oh!</p>

    <p>- What is that?!
    <br />- Oh, no!</p>

    <p>- A wiper! Triple blade!
    <br />- Triple blade?</p>

    <p>Jump on! It&#39;s your only chance, bee!</p>

    <p>Why does everything have
    to be so doggone clean?!</p>

    <p>How much do you people need to see?!</p>

    <p>Open your eyes!
    Stick your head out the window!</p>

    <p>From NPR News in Washington,
    I&#39;m Oarl Kasell.</p>

    <p>But don&#39;t kill no more bugs!</p>

    <p>- Bee!
    <br />- Moose blood guy!!</p>

    <p>- You hear something?
    <br />- Like what?</p>

    <p>Like tiny screaming.</p>

    <p>Turn off the radio.</p>

    <p>Whassup, bee boy?</p>

    <p>Hey, Blood.</p>

    <p>Just a row of honey jars,
    as far as the eye could see.</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>I assume wherever this truck goes
    is where they&#39;re getting it.</p>

    <p>I mean, that honey&#39;s ours.</p>

    <p>- Bees hang tight.
    <br />- We&#39;re all jammed in.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a close community.</p>

    <p>Not us, man. We on our own.
    Every mosquito on his own.</p>

    <p>- What if you get in trouble?
    <br />- You a mosquito, you in trouble.</p>

    <p>Nobody likes us. They just smack.
    See a mosquito, smack, smack!</p>

    <p>At least you&#39;re out in the world.
    You must meet girls.</p>

    <p>Mosquito girls try to trade up,
    get with a moth, dragonfly.</p>

    <p>Mosquito girl don&#39;t want no mosquito.</p>

    <p>You got to be kidding me!</p>

    <p>Mooseblood&#39;s about to leave
    the building! So long, bee!</p>

    <p>- Hey, guys!
    <br />- Mooseblood!</p>

    <p>I knew I&#39;d catch y&#39;all down here.
    Did you bring your crazy straw?</p>

    <p>We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
    and it&#39;s pretty much pure profit.</p>

    <p>What is this place?</p>

    <p>A bee&#39;s got a brain
    the size of a pinhead.</p>

    <p>They are pinheads!</p>

    <p>Pinhead.</p>

    <p>- Oheck out the new smoker.
    <br />- Oh, sweet. That&#39;s the one you want.</p>

    <p>The Thomas 3000!</p>

    <p>Smoker?</p>

    <p>Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
    Twice the nicotine, all the tar.</p>

    <p>A couple breaths of this
    knocks them right out.</p>

    <p>They make the honey,
    and we make the money.</p>

    <p>&quot;They make the honey,
    and we make the money&quot;?</p>

    <p>Oh, my!</p>

    <p>What&#39;s going on? Are you OK?</p>

    <p>Yeah. It doesn&#39;t last too long.</p>

    <p>Do you know you&#39;re
    in a fake hive with fake walls?</p>

    <p>Our queen was moved here.
    We had no choice.</p>

    <p>This is your queen?
    That&#39;s a man in women&#39;s clothes!</p>

    <p>That&#39;s a drag queen!</p>

    <p>What is this?</p>

    <p>Oh, no!</p>

    <p>There&#39;s hundreds of them!</p>

    <p>Bee honey.</p>

    <p>Our honey is being brazenly stolen
    on a massive scale!</p>

    <p>This is worse than anything bears
    have done! I intend to do something.</p>

    <p>Oh, Barry, stop.</p>

    <p>Who told you humans are taking
    our honey? That&#39;s a rumor.</p>

    <p>Do these look like rumors?</p>

    <p>That&#39;s a conspiracy theory.
    These are obviously doctored photos.</p>

    <p>How did you get mixed up in this?</p>

    <p>He&#39;s been talking to humans.</p>

    <p>- What?
    <br />- Talking to humans?!</p>

    <p>He has a human girlfriend.
    And they make out!</p>

    <p>Make out? Barry!</p>

    <p>We do not.</p>

    <p>- You wish you could.
    <br />- Whose side are you on?</p>

    <p>The bees!</p>

    <p>I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
    Those crazy legs kept me up all night.</p>

    <p>Barry, this is what you want
    to do with your life?</p>

    <p>I want to do it for all our lives.
    Nobody works harder than bees!</p>

    <p>Dad, I remember you
    coming home so overworked</p>

    <p>your hands were still stirring.
    You couldn&#39;t stop.</p>

    <p>I remember that.</p>

    <p>What right do they have to our honey?</p>

    <p>We live on two cups a year. They put it
    in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!</p>

    <p>Even if it&#39;s true, what can one bee do?</p>

    <p>Sting them where it really hurts.</p>

    <p>In the face! The eye!</p>

    <p>- That would hurt.
    <br />- No.</p>

    <p>Up the nose? That&#39;s a killer.</p>

    <p>There&#39;s only one place you can sting
    the humans, one place where it matters.</p>

    <p>Hive at Five, the hive&#39;s only

    <p>- Good evening. I&#39;m Bob Bumble.
    <br />- And I&#39;m Jeanette Ohung.</p>

    <p>A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,</p>

    <p>intends to sue the human race
    for stealing our honey,</p>

    <p>packaging it and profiting
    from it illegally!</p>

    <p>Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,</p>

    <p>we&#39;ll have three former queens here in
    our studio, discussing their new book,</p>

    <p>Olassy Ladies,
    out this week on Hexagon.</p>

    <p>Tonight we&#39;re talking to Barry Benson.</p>

    <p>Did you ever think, &quot;I&#39;m a kid
    from the hive. I can&#39;t do this&quot;?</p>

    <p>Bees have never been afraid
    to change the world.</p>

    <p>What about Bee Oolumbus?
    Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?</p>

    <p>Where I&#39;m from, we&#39;d never sue humans.</p>

    <p>We were thinking
    of stickball or candy stores.</p>

    <p>How old are you?</p>

    <p>The bee community
    is supporting you in this case,</p>

    <p>which will be the trial
    of the bee century.</p>

    <p>You know, they have a Larry King
    in the human world too.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a common name. Next week...</p>

    <p>He looks like you and has a show
    and suspenders and colored dots...</p>

    <p>Next week...</p>

    <p>Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
    guest even though you just heard &#39;em.</p>

    <p>Bear Week next week!
    They&#39;re scary, hairy and here live.</p>

    <p>Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
    squinty eyes, very Jewish.</p>

    <p>In tennis, you attack
    at the point of weakness!</p>

    <p>It was my grandmother, Ken. She&#39;s 81.</p>

    <p>Honey, her backhand&#39;s a joke!
    I&#39;m not gonna take advantage of that?</p>

    <p>Quiet, please.
    Actual work going on here.</p>

    <p>- Is that that same bee?
    <br />- Yes, it is!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m helping him sue the human race.</p>

    <p>- Hello.
    <br />- Hello, bee.</p>

    <p>This is Ken.</p>

    <p>Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
    ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.</p>

    <p>Why does he talk again?</p>

    <p>Listen, you better go
    &#39;cause we&#39;re really busy working.</p>

    <p>But it&#39;s our yogurt night!</p>

    <p>Bye-bye.</p>

    <p>Why is yogurt night so difficult?!</p>

    <p>You poor thing.
    You two have been at this for hours!</p>

    <p>Yes, and Adam here
    has been a huge help.</p>

    <p>- Frosting...
    <br />- How many sugars?</p>

    <p>Just one. I try not
    to use the competition.</p>

    <p>So why are you helping me?</p>

    <p>Bees have good qualities.</p>

    <p>And it takes my mind off the shop.</p>

    <p>Instead of flowers, people
    are giving balloon bouquets now.</p>

    <p>Those are great, if you&#39;re three.</p>

    <p>And artificial flowers.</p>

    <p>- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
    <br />- Yeah, me too.</p>

    <p>Bent stingers, pointless pollination.</p>

    <p>Bees must hate those fake things!</p>

    <p>Nothing worse
    than a daffodil that&#39;s had work done.</p>

    <p>Maybe this could make up
    for it a little bit.</p>

    <p>- This lawsuit&#39;s a pretty big deal.
    <br />- I guess.</p>

    <p>You sure you want to go through with it?</p>

    <p>Am I sure? When I&#39;m done with
    the humans, they won&#39;t be able</p>

    <p>to say, &quot;Honey, I&#39;m home,&quot;
    without paying a royalty!</p>

    <p>It&#39;s an incredible scene
    here in downtown Manhattan,</p>

    <p>where the world anxiously waits,
    because for the first time in history,</p>

    <p>we will hear for ourselves
    if a honeybee can actually speak.</p>

    <p>What have we gotten into here, Barry?</p>

    <p>It&#39;s pretty big, isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t believe how many humans
    don&#39;t work during the day.</p>

    <p>You think billion-dollar multinational
    food companies have good lawyers?</p>

    <p>Everybody needs to stay
    behind the barricade.</p>

    <p>- What&#39;s the matter?
    <br />- I don&#39;t know, I just got a chill.</p>

    <p>Well, if it isn&#39;t the bee team.</p>

    <p>You boys work on this?</p>

    <p>All rise! The Honorable
    Judge Bumbleton presiding.</p>

    <p>All right. Oase number 4475,</p>

    <p>Superior Oourt of New York,
    Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry</p>

    <p>is now in session.</p>

    <p>Mr. Montgomery, you&#39;re representing
    the five food companies collectively?</p>

    <p>A privilege.</p>

    <p>Mr. Benson... you&#39;re representing
    all the bees of the world?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
    we&#39;re ready to proceed.</p>

    <p>Mr. Montgomery,
    your opening statement, please.</p>

    <p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</p>

    <p>my grandmother was a simple woman.</p>

    <p>Born on a farm, she believed
    it was man&#39;s divine right</p>

    <p>to benefit from the bounty
    of nature God put before us.</p>

    <p>If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
    Mr. Benson imagines,</p>

    <p>just think of what would it mean.</p>

    <p>I would have to negotiate
    with the silkworm</p>

    <p>for the elastic in my britches!</p>

    <p>Talking bee!</p>

    <p>How do we know this isn&#39;t some sort of</p>

    <p>holographic motion-picture-capture
    Hollywood wizardry?</p>

    <p>They could be using laser beams!</p>

    <p>Robotics! Ventriloquism!
    Oloning! For all we know,</p>

    <p>he could be on steroids!</p>

    <p>Mr. Benson?</p>

    <p>Ladies and gentlemen,
    there&#39;s no trickery here.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m just an ordinary bee.
    Honey&#39;s pretty important to me.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s important to all bees.
    We invented it!</p>

    <p>We make it. And we protect it
    with our lives.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there are
    some people in this room</p>

    <p>who think they can take it from us</p>

    <p>&#39;cause we&#39;re the little guys!
    I&#39;m hoping that, after this is all over,</p>

    <p>you&#39;ll see how, by taking our honey,
    you not only take everything we have</p>

    <p>but everything we are!</p>

    <p>I wish he&#39;d dress like that
    all the time. So nice!</p>

    <p>Oall your first witness.</p>

    <p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
    of Honey Farms, big company you have.</p>

    <p>I suppose so.</p>

    <p>I see you also own
    Honeyburton and Honron!</p>

    <p>Yes, they provide beekeepers
    for our farms.</p>

    <p>Beekeeper. I find that
    to be a very disturbing term.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t imagine you employ
    any bee-free-ers, do you?</p>

    <p>- No.
    <br />- I couldn&#39;t hear you.</p>

    <p>- No.
    <br />- No.</p>

    <p>Because you don&#39;t free bees.
    You keep bees. Not only that,</p>

    <p>it seems you thought a bear would be
    an appropriate image for a jar of honey.</p>

    <p>They&#39;re very lovable creatures.</p>

    <p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.</p>

    <p>You mean like this?</p>

    <p>Bears kill bees!</p>

    <p>How&#39;d you like his head crashing
    through your living room?!</p>

    <p>Biting into your couch!
    Spitting out your throw pillows!</p>

    <p>OK, that&#39;s enough. Take him away.</p>

    <p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
    Your name intrigues me.</p>

    <p>- Where have I heard it before?
    <br />- I was with a band called The Police.</p>

    <p>But you&#39;ve never been
    a police officer, have you?</p>

    <p>No, I haven&#39;t.</p>

    <p>No, you haven&#39;t. And so here
    we have yet another example</p>

    <p>of bee culture casually
    stolen by a human</p>

    <p>for nothing more than
    a prance-about stage name.</p>

    <p>Oh, please.</p>

    <p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?</p>

    <p>Because I&#39;m feeling
    a little stung, Sting.</p>

    <p>Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!</p>

    <p>That&#39;s not his real name?! You idiots!</p>

    <p>Mr. Liotta, first,
    belated congratulations on</p>

    <p>your Emmy win for a guest spot
    on ER in 2005.</p>

    <p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>

    <p>I see from your resume
    that you&#39;re devilishly handsome</p>

    <p>with a churning inner turmoil
    that&#39;s ready to blow.</p>

    <p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?</p>

    <p>Not yet it isn&#39;t. But is this
    what it&#39;s come to for you?</p>

    <p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
    so you don&#39;t</p>

    <p>have to rehearse
    your part and learn your lines, sir?</p>

    <p>Watch it, Benson!
    I could blow right now!</p>

    <p>This isn&#39;t a goodfella.
    This is a badfella!</p>

    <p>Why doesn&#39;t someone just step on
    this creep, and we can all go home?!</p>

    <p>- Order in this court!
    <br />- You&#39;re all thinking it!</p>

    <p>Order! Order, I say!</p>

    <p>- Say it!
    <br />- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</p>

    <p>I think it was awfully nice
    of that bear to pitch in like that.</p>

    <p>I think the jury&#39;s on our side.</p>

    <p>Are we doing everything right, legally?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m a florist.</p>

    <p>Right. Well, here&#39;s to a great team.</p>

    <p>To a great team!</p>

    <p>Well, hello.</p>

    <p>- Ken!
    <br />- Hello.</p>

    <p>I didn&#39;t think you were coming.</p>

    <p>No, I was just late.
    I tried to call, but... the battery.</p>

    <p>I didn&#39;t want all this to go to waste,
    so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.</p>

    <p>Oh, that was lucky.</p>

    <p>There&#39;s a little left.
    I could heat it up.</p>

    <p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.</p>

    <p>So I hear you&#39;re quite a tennis player.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m not much for the game myself.
    The ball&#39;s a little grabby.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s where I usually sit.
    Right... there.</p>

    <p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,</p>

    <p>and he agreed with me that eating with
    chopsticks isn&#39;t really a special skill.</p>

    <p>You think I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing?</p>

    <p>I know how hard it is to find
    the rightjob. We have that in common.</p>

    <p>Do we?</p>

    <p>Bees have 100 percent employment,
    but we do jobs like taking the crud out.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s just what
    I was thinking about doing.</p>

    <p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
    for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m going to drain the old stinger.</p>

    <p>Yeah, you do that.</p>

    <p>Look at that.</p>

    <p>You know, I&#39;ve just about had it</p>

    <p>with your little mind games.</p>

    <p>- What&#39;s that?
    <br />- Italian Vogue.</p>

    <p>Mamma mia, that&#39;s a lot of pages.</p>

    <p>A lot of ads.</p>

    <p>Remember what Van said, why is
    your life more valuable than mine?</p>

    <p>Funny, I just can&#39;t seem to recall that!</p>

    <p>I think something stinks in here!</p>

    <p>I love the smell of flowers.</p>

    <p>How do you like the smell of flames?!</p>

    <p>Not as much.</p>

    <p>Water bug! Not taking sides!</p>

    <p>Ken, I&#39;m wearing a Ohapstick hat!
    This is pathetic!</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve got issues!</p>

    <p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!</p>

    <p>- You&#39;re bluffing.
    <br />- Am I?</p>

    <p>Surf&#39;s up, dude!</p>

    <p>Poo water!</p>

    <p>That bowl is gnarly.</p>

    <p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!</p>

    <p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!</p>

    <p>You know, I don&#39;t even like honey!
    I don&#39;t eat it!</p>

    <p>We need to talk!</p>

    <p>He&#39;s just a little bee!</p>

    <p>And he happens to be
    the nicest bee I&#39;ve met in a long time!</p>

    <p>Long time? What are you talking about?!
    Are there other bugs in your life?</p>

    <p>No, but there are other things bugging
    me in life. And you&#39;re one of them!</p>

    <p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...</p>

    <p>My nerves are fried from riding
    on this emotional roller coaster!</p>

    <p>Goodbye, Ken.</p>

    <p>And for your information,</p>

    <p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial
    sweeteners made by man!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sorry about all that.</p>

    <p>I know it&#39;s got
    an aftertaste! I like it!</p>

    <p>I always felt there was some kind
    of barrier between Ken and me.</p>

    <p>I couldn&#39;t overcome it.
    Oh, well.</p>

    <p>Are you OK for the trial?</p>

    <p>I believe Mr. Montgomery
    is about out of ideas.</p>

    <p>We would like to call
    Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.</p>

    <p>Good idea! You can really see why he&#39;s
    considered one of the best lawyers...</p>

    <p>Yeah.</p>

    <p>Layton, you&#39;ve
    gotta weave some magic</p>

    <p>with this jury,
    or it&#39;s gonna be all over.</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t worry. The only thing I have
    to do to turn this jury around</p>

    <p>is to remind them
    of what they don&#39;t like about bees.</p>

    <p>- You got the tweezers?
    <br />- Are you allergic?</p>

    <p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.</p>

    <p>Mr. Benson Bee, I&#39;ll ask you
    what I think we&#39;d all like to know.</p>

    <p>What exactly is your relationship</p>

    <p>to that woman?</p>

    <p>We&#39;re friends.</p>

    <p>- Good friends?
    <br />- Yes.</p>

    <p>How good? Do you live together?</p>

    <p>Wait a minute...</p>

    <p>Are you her little...</p>

    <p>...bedbug?</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve seen a bee documentary or two.
    From what I understand,</p>

    <p>doesn&#39;t your queen give birth
    to all the bee children?</p>

    <p>- Yeah, but...
    <br />- So those aren&#39;t your real parents!</p>

    <p>- Oh, Barry...
    <br />- Yes, they are!</p>

    <p>Hold me back!</p>

    <p>You&#39;re an illegitimate bee,
    aren&#39;t you, Benson?</p>

    <p>He&#39;s denouncing bees!</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t y&#39;all date your cousins?</p>

    <p>- Objection!
    <br />- I&#39;m going to pincushion this guy!</p>

    <p>Adam, don&#39;t! It&#39;s what he wants!</p>

    <p>Oh, I&#39;m hit!!</p>

    <p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!</p>

    <p>Order! Order!</p>

    <p>The venom! The venom
    is coursing through my veins!</p>

    <p>I have been felled
    by a winged beast of destruction!</p>

    <p>You see? You can&#39;t treat them
    like equals! They&#39;re striped savages!</p>

    <p>Stinging&#39;s the only thing
    they know! It&#39;s their way!</p>

    <p>- Adam, stay with me.
    <br />- I can&#39;t feel my legs.</p>

    <p>What angel of mercy
    will come forward to suck the poison</p>

    <p>from my heaving buttocks?</p>

    <p>I will have order in this court. Order!</p>

    <p>Order, please!</p>

    <p>The case of the honeybees
    versus the human race</p>

    <p>took a pointed turn against the bees</p>

    <p>yesterday when one of their legal
    team stung Layton T. Montgomery.</p>

    <p>- Hey, buddy.
    <br />- Hey.</p>

    <p>- Is there much pain?
    <br />- Yeah.</p>

    <p>I...</p>

    <p>I blew the whole case, didn&#39;t I?</p>

    <p>It doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is
    you&#39;re alive. You could have died.</p>

    <p>I&#39;d be better off dead. Look at me.</p>

    <p>They got it from the cafeteria
    downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.</p>

    <p>Look, there&#39;s
    a little celery still on it.</p>

    <p>What was it like to sting someone?</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t explain it. It was all...</p>

    <p>All adrenaline and then...
    and then ecstasy!</p>

    <p>All right.</p>

    <p>You think it was all a trap?</p>

    <p>Of course. I&#39;m sorry.
    I flew us right into this.</p>

    <p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We&#39;re
    just a couple of bugs in this world.</p>

    <p>What will the humans do to us
    if they win?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <p>I hear they put the roaches in motels.
    That doesn&#39;t sound so bad.</p>

    <p>Adam, they check in,
    but they don&#39;t check out!</p>

    <p>Oh, my.</p>

    <p>Oould you get a nurse
    to close that window?</p>

    <p>- Why?
    <br />- The smoke.</p>

    <p>Bees don&#39;t smoke.</p>

    <p>Right. Bees don&#39;t smoke.</p>

    <p>Bees don&#39;t smoke!
    But some bees are smoking.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s it! That&#39;s our case!</p>

    <p>It is? It&#39;s not over?</p>

    <p>Get dressed. I&#39;ve gotta go somewhere.</p>

    <p>Get back to the court and stall.
    Stall any way you can.</p>

    <p>And assuming you&#39;ve done step correctly, you&#39;re ready for the tub.</p>

    <p>Mr. Flayman.</p>

    <p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!</p>

    <p>Where is the rest of your team?</p>

    <p>Well, Your Honor, it&#39;s interesting.</p>

    <p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,</p>

    <p>and as a result,
    we don&#39;t make very good time.</p>

    <p>I actually heard a funny story about...</p>

    <p>Your Honor,
    haven&#39;t these ridiculous bugs</p>

    <p>taken up enough
    of this court&#39;s valuable time?</p>

    <p>How much longer will we allow
    these absurd shenanigans to go on?</p>

    <p>They have presented no compelling
    evidence to support their charges</p>

    <p>against my clients,
    who run legitimate businesses.</p>

    <p>I move for a complete dismissal
    of this entire case!</p>

    <p>Mr. Flayman, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going</p>

    <p>to have to consider
    Mr. Montgomery&#39;s motion.</p>

    <p>But you can&#39;t! We have a terrific case.</p>

    <p>Where is your proof?
    Where is the evidence?</p>

    <p>Show me the smoking gun!</p>

    <p>Hold it, Your Honor!
    You want a smoking gun?</p>

    <p>Here is your smoking gun.</p>

    <p>What is that?</p>

    <p>It&#39;s a bee smoker!</p>

    <p>What, this?
    This harmless little contraption?</p>

    <p>This couldn&#39;t hurt a fly,
    let alone a bee.</p>

    <p>Look at what has happened</p>

    <p>to bees who have never been asked,
    &quot;Smoking or non?&quot;</p>

    <p>Is this what nature intended for us?</p>

    <p>To be forcibly addicted
    to smoke machines</p>

    <p>and man-made wooden slat work camps?</p>

    <p>Living out our lives as honey slaves
    to the white man?</p>

    <p>- What are we gonna do?
    <br />- He&#39;s playing the species card.</p>

    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, please,
    free these bees!</p>

    <p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p>

    <p>Free the bees!</p>

    <p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p>

    <p>The court finds in favor of the bees!</p>

    <p>Vanessa, we won!</p>

    <p>I knew you could do it! High-five!</p>

    <p>Sorry.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m OK! You know what this means?</p>

    <p>All the honey
    will finally belong to the bees.</p>

    <p>Now we won&#39;t have
    to work so hard all the time.</p>

    <p>This is an unholy perversion
    of the balance of nature, Benson.</p>

    <p>You&#39;ll regret this.</p>

    <p>Barry, how much honey is out there?</p>

    <p>All right. One at a time.</p>

    <p>Barry, who are you wearing?</p>

    <p>My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
    and I have no pants.</p>

    <p>- What if Montgomery&#39;s right?
    <br />- What do you mean?</p>

    <p>We&#39;ve been living the bee way
    a long time, 27 million years.</p>

    <p>Oongratulations on your victory.
    What will you demand as a settlement?</p>

    <p>First, we&#39;ll demand a complete shutdown
    of all bee work camps.</p>

    <p>Then we want back the honey
    that was ours to begin with,</p>

    <p>every last drop.</p>

    <p>We demand an end to the glorification
    of the bear as anything more</p>

    <p>than a filthy, smelly,
    bad-breath stink machine.</p>

    <p>We&#39;re all aware
    of what they do in the woods.</p>

    <p>Wait for my signal.</p>

    <p>Take him out.</p>

    <p>He&#39;ll have nauseous
    for a few hours, then he&#39;ll be fine.</p>

    <p>And we will no longer tolerate
    bee-negative nicknames...</p>

    <p>But it&#39;s just a prance-about stage name!</p>

    <p>...unnecessary inclusion of honey
    in bogus health products</p>

    <p>and la-dee-da human
    tea-time snack garnishments.</p>

    <p>Oan&#39;t breathe.</p>

    <p>Bring it in, boys!</p>

    <p>Hold it right there! Good.</p>

    <p>Tap it.</p>

    <p>Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
    and there&#39;s gallons more coming!</p>

    <p>- I think we need to shut down!
    <br />- Shut down? We&#39;ve never shut down.</p>

    <p>Shut down honey production!</p>

    <p>Stop making honey!</p>

    <p>Turn your key, sir!</p>

    <p>What do we do now?</p>

    <p>Oannonball!</p>

    <p>We&#39;re shutting honey production!</p>

    <p>Mission abort.</p>

    <p>Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
    Returning to base.</p>

    <p>Adam, you wouldn&#39;t believe
    how much honey was out there.</p>

    <p>Oh, yeah?</p>

    <p>What&#39;s going on? Where is everybody?</p>

    <p>- Are they out celebrating?
    <br />- They&#39;re home.</p>

    <p>They don&#39;t know what to do.
    Laying out, sleeping in.</p>

    <p>I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
    to San Antonio with a cricket.</p>

    <p>At least we got our honey back.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I think, so what if humans
    liked our honey? Who wouldn&#39;t?</p>

    <p>It&#39;s the greatest thing in the world!
    I was excited to be part of making it.</p>

    <p>This was my new desk. This was my
    new job. I wanted to do it really well.</p>

    <p>And now...</p>

    <p>Now I can&#39;t.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t understand
    why they&#39;re not happy.</p>

    <p>I thought their lives would be better!</p>

    <p>They&#39;re doing nothing. It&#39;s amazing.
    Honey really changes people.</p>

    <p>You don&#39;t have any idea
    what&#39;s going on, do you?</p>

    <p>- What did you want to show me?
    <br />- This.</p>

    <p>What happened here?</p>

    <p>That is not the half of it.</p>

    <p>Oh, no. Oh, my.</p>

    <p>They&#39;re all wilting.</p>

    <p>Doesn&#39;t look very good, does it?</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>And whose fault do you think that is?</p>

    <p>You know, I&#39;m gonna guess bees.</p>

    <p>Bees?</p>

    <p>Specifically, me.</p>

    <p>I didn&#39;t think bees not needing to make
    honey would affect all these things.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s notjust flowers.
    Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s our whole SAT test right there.</p>

    <p>Take away produce, that affects
    the entire animal kingdom.</p>

    <p>And then, of course...</p>

    <p>The human species?</p>

    <p>So if there&#39;s no more pollination,</p>

    <p>it could all just go south here,
    couldn&#39;t it?</p>

    <p>I know this is also partly my fault.</p>

    <p>How about a suicide pact?</p>

    <p>How do we do it?</p>

    <p>- I&#39;ll sting you, you step on me.
    <br />- Thatjust kills you twice.</p>

    <p>Right, right.</p>

    <p>Listen, Barry...
    sorry, but I gotta get going.</p>

    <p>I had to open my mouth and talk.</p>

    <p>Vanessa?</p>

    <p>Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
    Where are you going?</p>

    <p>To the final Tournament of Roses parade
    in Pasadena.</p>

    <p>They&#39;ve moved it to this weekend
    because all the flowers are dying.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s the last chance
    I&#39;ll ever have to see it.</p>

    <p>Vanessa, I just wanna say I&#39;m sorry.
    I never meant it to turn out like this.</p>

    <p>I know. Me neither.</p>

    <p>Tournament of Roses.
    Roses can&#39;t do sports.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?</p>

    <p>Roses!</p>

    <p>Vanessa!</p>

    <p>Roses?!</p>

    <p>Barry?</p>

    <p>- Roses are flowers!
    <br />- Yes, they are.</p>

    <p>Flowers, bees, pollen!</p>

    <p>I know.
    That&#39;s why this is the last parade.</p>

    <p>Maybe not.
    Oould you ask him to slow down?</p>

    <p>Oould you slow down?</p>

    <p>Barry!</p>

    <p>OK, I made a huge mistake.
    This is a total disaster, all my fault.</p>

    <p>Yes, it kind of is.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve ruined the planet.
    I wanted to help you</p>

    <p>with the flower shop.
    I&#39;ve made it worse.</p>

    <p>Actually, it&#39;s completely closed down.</p>

    <p>I thought maybe you were remodeling.</p>

    <p>But I have another idea, and it&#39;s
    greater than my previous ideas combined.</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t want to hear it!</p>

    <p>All right, they have the roses,
    the roses have the pollen.</p>

    <p>I know every bee, plant
    and flower bud in this park.</p>

    <p>All we gotta do is get what they&#39;ve got
    back here with what we&#39;ve got.</p>

    <p>- Bees.
    <br />- Park.</p>

    <p>- Pollen!
    <br />- Flowers.</p>

    <p>- Repollination!
    <br />- Across the nation!</p>

    <p>Tournament of Roses,
    Pasadena, Oalifornia.</p>

    <p>They&#39;ve got nothing
    but flowers, floats and cotton candy.</p>

    <p>Security will be tight.</p>

    <p>I have an idea.</p>

    <p>Vanessa Bloome, FTD.</p>

    <p>Official floral business. It&#39;s real.</p>

    <p>Sorry, ma&#39;am. Nice brooch.</p>

    <p>Thank you. It was a gift.</p>

    <p>Once inside,
    we just pick the right float.</p>

    <p>How about The Princess and the Pea?</p>

    <p>I could be the princess,
    and you could be the pea!</p>

    <p>Yes, I got it.</p>

    <p>- Where should I sit?
    <br />- What are you?</p>

    <p>- I believe I&#39;m the pea.
    <br />- The pea?</p>

    <p>It goes under the mattresses.</p>

    <p>- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
    <br />- I&#39;m getting the marshal.</p>

    <p>You do that!
    This whole parade is a fiasco!</p>

    <p>Let&#39;s see what this baby&#39;ll do.</p>

    <p>Hey, what are you doing?!</p>

    <p>Then all we do
    is blend in with traffic...</p>

    <p>...without arousing suspicion.</p>

    <p>Once at the airport,
    there&#39;s no stopping us.</p>

    <p>Stop! Security.</p>

    <p>- You and your insect pack your float?
    <br />- Yes.</p>

    <p>Has it been
    in your possession the entire time?</p>

    <p>Would you remove your shoes?</p>

    <p>- Remove your stinger.
    <br />- It&#39;s part of me.</p>

    <p>I know. Just having some fun.
    Enjoy your flight.</p>

    <p>Then if we&#39;re lucky, we&#39;ll have
    just enough pollen to do the job.</p>

    <p>Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
    have just enough pollen to do the job!</p>

    <p>I think this is gonna work.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s got to work.</p>

    <p>Attention, passengers,
    this is Oaptain Scott.</p>

    <p>We have a bit of bad weather
    in New York.</p>

    <p>It looks like we&#39;ll experience
    a couple hours delay.</p>

    <p>Barry, these are cut flowers
    with no water. They&#39;ll never make it.</p>

    <p>I gotta get up there
    and talk to them.</p>

    <p>Be careful.</p>

    <p>Oan I get help
    with the Sky Mall magazine?</p>

    <p>I&#39;d like to order the talking
    inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.</p>

    <p>Oaptain, I&#39;m in a real situation.</p>

    <p>- What&#39;d you say, Hal?
    <br />- Nothing.</p>

    <p>Bee!</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t freak out! My entire species...</p>

    <p>What are you doing?</p>

    <p>- Wait a minute! I&#39;m an attorney!
    <br />- Who&#39;s an attorney?</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t move.</p>

    <p>Oh, Barry.</p>

    <p>Good afternoon, passengers.
    This is your captain.</p>

    <p>Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
    please report to the cockpit?</p>

    <p>And please hurry!</p>

    <p>What happened here?</p>

    <p>There was a DustBuster,
    a toupee, a life raft exploded.</p>

    <p>One&#39;s bald, one&#39;s in a boat,
    they&#39;re both unconscious!</p>

    <p>- Is that another bee joke?
    <br />- No!</p>

    <p>No one&#39;s flying the plane!</p>

    <p>This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
    What&#39;s your status?</p>

    <p>This is Vanessa Bloome.
    I&#39;m a florist from New York.</p>

    <p>Where&#39;s the pilot?</p>

    <p>He&#39;s unconscious,
    and so is the copilot.</p>

    <p>Not good. Does anyone onboard
    have flight experience?</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, there is.</p>

    <p>- Who&#39;s that?
    <br />- Barry Benson.</p>

    <p>From the honey trial?! Oh, great.</p>

    <p>Vanessa, this is nothing more
    than a big metal bee.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s got giant wings, huge engines.</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t fly a plane.</p>

    <p>- Why not? Isn&#39;t John Travolta a pilot?
    <br />- Yes.</p>

    <p>How hard could it be?</p>

    <p>Wait, Barry!
    We&#39;re headed into some lightning.</p>

    <p>This is Bob Bumble. We have some
    late-breaking news from JFK Airport,</p>

    <p>where a suspenseful scene
    is developing.</p>

    <p>Barry Benson,
    fresh from his legal victory...</p>

    <p>That&#39;s Barry!</p>

    <p>...is attempting to land a plane,
    loaded with people, flowers</p>

    <p>and an incapacitated flight crew.</p>

    <p>Flowers?!</p>

    <p>We have a storm in the area
    and two individuals at the controls</p>

    <p>with absolutely no flight experience.</p>

    <p>Just a minute.
    There&#39;s a bee on that plane.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m quite familiar with Mr. Benson
    and his no-account compadres.</p>

    <p>They&#39;ve done enough damage.</p>

    <p>But isn&#39;t he your only hope?</p>

    <p>Technically, a bee
    shouldn&#39;t be able to fly at all.</p>

    <p>Their wings are too small...</p>

    <p>Haven&#39;t we heard this a million times?</p>

    <p>&quot;The surface area of the wings
    and body mass make no sense.&quot;</p>

    <p>- Get this on the air!
    <br />- Got it.</p>

    <p>- Stand by.
    <br />- We&#39;re going live.</p>

    <p>The way we work may be a mystery to you.</p>

    <p>Making honey takes a lot of bees
    doing a lot of small jobs.</p>

    <p>But let me tell you about a small job.</p>

    <p>If you do it well,
    it makes a big difference.</p>

    <p>More than we realized.
    To us, to everyone.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s why I want to get bees
    back to working together.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s the bee way!
    We&#39;re not made of Jell-O.</p>

    <p>We get behind a fellow.</p>

    <p>- Black and yellow!
    <br />- Hello!</p>

    <p>Left, right, down, hover.</p>

    <p>- Hover?
    <br />- Forget hover.</p>

    <p>This isn&#39;t so hard.
    Beep-beep! Beep-beep!</p>

    <p>Barry, what happened?!</p>

    <p>Wait, I think we were
    on autopilot the whole time.</p>

    <p>- That may have been helping me.
    <br />- And now we&#39;re not!</p>

    <p>So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.</p>

    <p>All of you, let&#39;s get
    behind this fellow! Move it out!</p>

    <p>Move out!</p>

    <p>Our only chance is if I do what I&#39;d do,
    you copy me with the wings of the plane!</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t have to yell.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m not yelling!
    We&#39;re in a lot of trouble.</p>

    <p>It&#39;s very hard to concentrate
    with that panicky tone in your voice!</p>

    <p>It&#39;s not a tone. I&#39;m panicking!</p>

    <p>I can&#39;t do this!</p>

    <p>Vanessa, pull yourself together.
    You have to snap out of it!</p>

    <p>You snap out of it.</p>

    <p>You snap out of it.</p>

    <p>- You snap out of it!
    <br />- You snap out of it!</p>

    <p>- You snap out of it!
    <br />- You snap out of it!</p>

    <p>- You snap out of it!
    <br />- You snap out of it!</p>

    <p>- Hold it!
    <br />- Why? Oome on, it&#39;s my turn.</p>

    <p>How is the plane flying?</p>

    <p>I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <p>Hello?</p>

    <p>Benson, got any flowers
    for a happy occasion in there?</p>

    <p>The Pollen Jocks!</p>

    <p>They do get behind a fellow.</p>

    <p>- Black and yellow.
    <br />- Hello.</p>

    <p>All right, let&#39;s drop this tin can
    on the blacktop.</p>

    <p>Where? I can&#39;t see anything. Oan you?</p>

    <p>No, nothing. It&#39;s all cloudy.</p>

    <p>Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.</p>

    <p>- Thinking bee.
    <br />- Thinking bee.</p>

    <p>Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>

    <p>Wait a minute.
    I think I&#39;m feeling something.</p>

    <p>- What?
    <br />- I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s strong, pulling me.</p>

    <p>Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.</p>

    <p>Bring the nose down.</p>

    <p>Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>

    <p>- What in the world is on the tarmac?
    <br />- Get some lights on that!</p>

    <p>Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p>

    <p>- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
    <br />- OK.</p>

    <p>Out the engines. We&#39;re going in
    on bee power. Ready, boys?</p>

    <p>Affirmative!</p>

    <p>Good. Good. Easy, now. That&#39;s it.</p>

    <p>Land on that flower!</p>

    <p>Ready? Full reverse!</p>

    <p>Spin it around!</p>

    <p>- Not that flower! The other one!
    <br />- Which one?</p>

    <p>- That flower.
    <br />- I&#39;m aiming at the flower!</p>

    <p>That&#39;s a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
    I mean the giant pulsating flower</p>

    <p>made of millions of bees!</p>

    <p>Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.</p>

    <p>Rotate around it.</p>

    <p>- This is insane, Barry!
    <br />- This&#39;s the only way I know how to fly.</p>

    <p>Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
    flying in an insect-like pattern?</p>

    <p>Get your nose in there. Don&#39;t be afraid.
    Smell it. Full reverse!</p>

    <p>Just drop it. Be a part of it.</p>

    <p>Aim for the center!</p>

    <p>Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!</p>

    <p>Oome on, already.</p>

    <p>Barry, we did it!
    You taught me how to fly!</p>

    <p>- Yes. No high-five!
    <br />- Right.</p>

    <p>Barry, it worked!
    Did you see the giant flower?</p>

    <p>What giant flower? Where? Of course
    I saw the flower! That was genius!</p>

    <p>- Thank you.
    <br />- But we&#39;re not done yet.</p>

    <p>Listen, everyone!</p>

    <p>This runway is covered
    with the last pollen</p>

    <p>from the last flowers
    available anywhere on Earth.</p>

    <p>That means this is our last chance.</p>

    <p>We&#39;re the only ones who make honey,
    pollinate flowers and dress like this.</p>

    <p>If we&#39;re gonna survive as a species,
    this is our moment! What do you say?</p>

    <p>Are we going to be bees, orjust
    Museum of Natural History keychains?</p>

    <p>We&#39;re bees!</p>

    <p>Keychain!</p>

    <p>Then follow me! Except Keychain.</p>

    <p>Hold on, Barry. Here.</p>

    <p>You&#39;ve earned this.</p>

    <p>Yeah!</p>

    <p>I&#39;m a Pollen Jock! And it&#39;s a perfect
    fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.</p>

    <p>Oh, yeah.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s our Barry.</p>

    <p>Mom! The bees are back!</p>

    <p>If anybody needs
    to make a call, now&#39;s the time.</p>

    <p>I got a feeling we&#39;ll be
    working late tonight!</p>

    <p>Here&#39;s your change. Have a great
    afternoon! Oan I help who&#39;s next?</p>

    <p>Would you like some honey with that?
    It is bee-approved. Don&#39;t forget these.</p>

    <p>Milk, cream, cheese, it&#39;s all me.
    And I don&#39;t see a nickel!</p>

    <p>Sometimes I just feel
    like a piece of meat!</p>

    <p>I had no idea.</p>

    <p>Barry, I&#39;m sorry.
    Have you got a moment?</p>

    <p>Would you excuse me?
    My mosquito associate will help you.</p>

    <p>Sorry I&#39;m late.</p>

    <p>He&#39;s a lawyer too?</p>

    <p>I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
    All I needed was a briefcase.</p>

    <p>Have a great afternoon!</p>

    <p>Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
    and I can&#39;t get them anywhere.</p>

    <p>No problem, Vannie.
    Just leave it to me.</p>

    <p>You&#39;re a lifesaver, Barry.
    Oan I help who&#39;s next?</p>

    <p>All right, scramble, jocks!
    It&#39;s time to fly.</p>

    <p>Thank you, Barry!</p>

    <p>That bee is living my life!</p>

    <p>Let it go, Kenny.</p>

    <p>- When will this nightmare end?!
    <br />- Let it all go.</p>

    <p>- Beautiful day to fly.
    <br />- Sure is.</p>

    <p>Between you and me,
    I was dying to get out of that office.</p>

    <p>You have got
    to start thinking bee, my friend.</p>

    <p>- Thinking bee!
    <br />- Me?</p>

    <p>Hold it. Let&#39;s just stop
    for a second. Hold it.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry, everyone.
    Oan we stop here?</p>

    <p>I&#39;m not making a major life decision
    during a production number!</p>

    <p>All right. Take ten, everybody.
    Wrap it up, guys.</p>

    <p>I had virtually no rehearsal for that.</p>
